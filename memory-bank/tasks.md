## Current Tasks

### UI Improvements
- **Task 19: Implement Inline Keyboard for Main Menu**
  - Create inline keyboard for main menu options
  - Add `/menu` command to display the main menu
  - Update all feature flows to work with inline keyboard
  - Refactor and clean up redundant code
  - Test all navigation paths

### Feature: Journaling Flow Enhancements (Level 3)

#### Requirements Analysis
- Core Requirements:
  - [x] Change "Analyze & ..." button text to "üçë Analyze".
  - [x] Update `/analyze` command: Generate a short, formatted summary *and* 2-3 insights/ideas/questions from user messages.
  - [x] Update `/new_entry` initial state: Use specific message text and show only a "Cancel" button.
  - [x] Update `/new_entry` voice/video processing: Show *no* keyboard when replying with transcription.
- Technical Constraints:
  - [x] Adhere to existing AI service interaction patterns.
  - [x] Maintain consistency with bot's HTML message formatting.

#### Component Analysis
- Affected Components:
  - `src/features/journal-entry/keyboards/`: Likely contains the keyboard definition for the "Analyze" button.
  - `src/commands/analyze.ts` (or similar): Handler for the analyze command logic.
  - `src/services/ai/`: Service used by `/analyze` for text processing (prompt/parsing adjustments needed).
  - `src/commands/new_entry.ts` (or similar): Handler for the new entry command logic (initial state and media processing).
  - `src/features/journal-entry/handlers/`: May contain specific logic handlers for different states within journal entry.
  - Potentially localization files if text is stored separately.

#### Design Decisions
- Architecture: N/A (Existing architecture sufficient)
- UI/UX:
  - [x] Use "üçë Analyze" for the button text.
  - [x] Format the `/analyze` summary using paragraphs/bullet points as appropriate for readability.
  - [x] Use the exact requested text for the `/new_entry` initial message.
  - [x] Hide keyboard entirely for transcription messages in `/new_entry`.
- Algorithms: N/A (Standard text processing and command handling)

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Analyze Command Update:**
   - [x] Modify AI service call/prompt in `src/services/ai/` to request summary and insights.
   - [x] Update response parsing logic in `src/commands/analyze.ts` to handle the new format.
   - [x] Implement message formatting for the summary and insights.
2. **UI Text/Keyboard Changes:**
   - [x] Locate and update the "Analyze & ..." button text to "üçë Analyze" in the relevant keyboard file (`src/features/journal-entry/keyboards/`).
   - [x] Locate and update the initial message text for `/new_entry` in `src/commands/new_entry.ts` or its handler.
   - [x] Modify the keyboard definition for the `/new_entry` initial message to only include "Cancel".
   - [x] Modify the logic in `/new_entry` (or handler) to send no keyboard when replying to voice/video with transcription.
3. **Testing:**
   - [ ] Test the `/analyze` command with various inputs to ensure correct summary/insight generation and formatting.
   - [ ] Verify the "üçë Analyze" button text appears correctly.
   - [ ] Test the `/new_entry` command: verify initial message text and keyboard.
   - [ ] Test `/new_entry` with voice/video: verify transcription reply has no keyboard.

#### Testing Strategy
- Unit Tests:
  - [ ] Test AI service response parsing logic (if complex).
  - [ ] Test message formatting functions.
- Integration Tests: N/A for this scope.
- Manual Tests:
  - [ ] Execute `/analyze` command workflow.
  - [ ] Execute `/new_entry` command workflow (start, send text, send voice/video).

#### Documentation Plan
- [x] Update relevant sections in `app_functionality.md` if command behavior significantly changes (mention summary/insights in `/analyze`).

#### Dependencies
- AI Service (`src/services/ai/`) availability and response format.

#### Challenges & Mitigations
- Challenge: AI service might not reliably generate both summary and insights in the desired format.
  - Mitigation: Adjust prompt engineering; implement robust parsing with fallbacks.
- Challenge: Locating the exact files for UI elements/keyboards.
  - Mitigation: Use `grep_search` if needed.

#### Creative Phases Required
- None

#### Status
- [x] Planning complete
- [x] Implementation complete
- [ ] Testing complete
- [x] Documentation complete
