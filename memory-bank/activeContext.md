# Euphoria Bot - Active Context

## Current Project Status
The Euphoria bot is fully operational with all core features implemented:
- âœ… Core bot framework
- âœ… User onboarding
- âœ… Journal entry creation (text, voice, video)
- âœ… Journal history browsing
- âœ… Journal-based AI chat
- âœ… Settings management
- âœ… Notification system
- âœ… Human Design integration

Recent work has focused on Human Design integration, which is now complete.

## Current Development Focus
We are now implementing UI improvements to enhance the user experience:
- ðŸ”„ Converting the main menu from regular keyboard to inline keyboard
- ðŸ”„ Adding a `/menu` command for improved accessibility
- ðŸ”„ Refactoring related navigation flows for consistency

## System Architecture
The bot is built on a modular architecture with:
- Feature-based organization
- Service-oriented design
- MongoDB database
- OpenAI integration for AI capabilities

## Key Components
1. **Bot Framework**: Grammy-based Telegram bot with middleware
2. **Features**: Modular functionality organized by feature area
3. **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling
4. **Services**: Cross-cutting concerns like AI and notifications
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management system
6. **Admin**: Basic admin functionality for monitoring

## Recent Tasks
Most recent work focused on implementing Human Design integration:
1. **Update Database Schema**: Added Human Design chart collection and user references
2. **Human Design API Service**: Created service for interacting with external API
3. **Timezone Lookup**: Added location-based timezone resolution
4. **Chart Generation**: Implemented chart generation with caching
5. **User Commands**: Added commands for generating and discussing Human Design charts
6. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive API documentation
7. **Testing**: Implemented end-to-end testing for the Human Design features

## Current Task: Inline Keyboard Main Menu
We are implementing a more modern UI approach by:
1. **Creating an inline keyboard** for main menu options
2. **Adding a `/menu` command** to display the main menu
3. **Updating feature flows** to work with the inline keyboard
4. **Refactoring navigation code** for consistency and simplicity
5. **Removing redundant code** related to menu interactions

## Current Challenges
- Maintaining consistent user experience across different entry points
- Ensuring backward compatibility for users in the middle of flows
- Optimizing AI prompt engineering for better journal insights
- Managing voice/video transcription costs
- Ensuring notification delivery reliability
- Maintaining conversation context in complex chat flows
- Handling rate limits with external APIs

## Next Development Areas
1. **Enhanced AI Analysis**:
   - More personalized journal insights
   - Pattern recognition across entries
   - Sentiment analysis over time

2. **Improved Notification System**:
   - Smarter scheduling based on user behavior
   - More engaging notification content
   - Better tracking of notification effectiveness

3. **Advanced Search**:
   - Full-text search of journal entries
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Filtering by date, sentiment, topics

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching strategies for frequent operations
   - Resource usage monitoring

5. **Multilingual Support**:
   - Localization infrastructure
   - Translation of core messages
   - Language-specific AI prompts
