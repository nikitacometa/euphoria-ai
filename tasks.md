# Task: Update Inline Keyboard Handling

**Complexity Level:** 2 (Simple Enhancement)

## 1. Overview of Changes

The goal is to modify how the bot handles interactions with inline keyboards. When a user clicks a button on an inline keyboard:
1. The inline keyboard should be removed from the message.
2. The message text **should remain the same**.
3. If the message has already been deleted, the bot should gracefully handle the error and not attempt to edit it.

This change will improve the user experience by preventing interactions with outdated keyboards and providing clear feedback.

## 2. Files Modified

The following files were modified to implement the required changes:

* Created utility file:
  * `src/utils/inline-keyboard.ts` - Contains utility functions for removing inline keyboards and error handling

* Updated callback handlers in:
  * `src/features/core/index.ts` - Main menu callbacks
  * `src/features/journal-entry/index.ts` - Journal entry handling callbacks
  * `src/features/journal-history/index.ts` - Journal history viewing/deleting callbacks
  * `src/features/journal-chat/handlers.ts` - Journal chat callbacks
  * `src/features/settings/index.ts` - Settings callbacks

## 3. Implementation Details

1. ✅ **Created a Utility Function:**
   * Created `removeInlineKeyboard()` function that removes the keyboard and handles errors
   * Created `withKeyboardRemoval()` wrapper function for future use if needed
   * Added proper error handling for cases where the message was already deleted

2. ✅ **Updated Callback Handlers:**
   * Added the utility function to all callback query handlers
   * Ensured keyboards are removed immediately after button press
   * Added try/catch blocks to prevent errors from interrupting the flow
   * Added proper logging for error cases

3. ✅ **Error Handling:**
   * Added specific handling for "message not found" and "message is not modified" errors
   * Implemented logging of errors without crashing the application

## 4. Testing

* **Unit Tests:** Not required as the implementation doesn't contain complex logic
* **Manual Testing:** Required to verify that:
  * Keyboards are properly removed after button press
  * Original message text remains unchanged
  * No errors occur if message is deleted before keyboard removal attempt
  * Normal functionality continues to work as expected

## 5. Potential Extensions

* The `withKeyboardRemoval()` wrapper function could be used in the future to simplify adding this behavior to new handlers
* Error handling could be expanded to include more specific Telegram API error codes if needed
